# ElevateLabs - Task 5 (GitHub Pages)

Hi, I deployed this static website to GitHub Pages as part of **Task 5**. This README explains what I did, how to download the site, and how to run or update it. It's written in the first person and is self-explanatory.

If you prefer to work locally, clone the repo with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rajatt0502/Task-5-Elevate-Labs.git
cd Task-5-Elevate-Labs
```

- `js/` - optional JavaScript  
- `images/` - screenshots and assets  
- `README.md` - this document

## How I deployed (short)
1. Created the repo `Task-5-Elevate-Labs` on my GitHub account.  
2. Cloned it locally and copied my static files into the folder.  
3. Committed and pushed to `main`.  
4. Enabled **GitHub Pages** from **Settings â†’ Pages** (Branch: `main`, Root: `/`).  
5. Opened the site at `https://rajatt0502.github.io/Task-5-Elevate-Labs/`.

## How to update the site
Make your changes locally, then:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update site content"
git push origin main
```
Pages will update within a few minutes.

---

## Quick troubleshooting
- If the site does not appear, wait a few minutes and refresh the URL.  
- If `git push` returns `403` permission denied, I cleared cached credentials or used a Personal Access Token (PAT) / SSH key to authenticate.  
- Ensure you're pushing to the correct repo and branch (`main`).
